# RSA-Demonstration


This is a project that I had completed with 3 of my classmates as part of the mandatory project submission for my Class 12 Computer Science course.
It is an application that implements RSA encryption and decrytpion and simulates secure communication among 3 preset user profiles - Alice, Bob, Oscar.

To run the program:
1. Save all related files to a common path
2. Run file gui.py

Preset UserID and Password for the 3 user profiles are:
 - Alice ; a123
 - Bob ; b123
 - Oscar ; c123

For more details on the project refer to the [project report](https://github.com/Aathira-S/RSA-Demonstration/blob/main/RSA_Computer_Project_NEW.pdf).
