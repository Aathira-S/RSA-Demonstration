# RSA-Demonstration


This is an application that implements RSA encryption and decrytpion and simulates secure communication among 3 preset user profiles - Alice, Bob, Oscar.

To run the program:
1. Save all related files to a common path
2. Run file gui.py

Preset UserID and Password for the 3 user profiles are:
[Alice ; a123]
[Bob ; b123]
[Oscar ; c123]
